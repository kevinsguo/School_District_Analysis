# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is an analysis for an individual school district. The purpose is to create an detailed analyzation to get a better understanding of each school's performance relative to each other, and future budgeting prospects. The analyzation would also compare the results after Thomas High School's 9th grades were removed due to dishonesty questions. 

## Results

The calculated analysis are as follows:
 - The average math and reading scores received by students in each grade level of each school
 - Top 5 and bottom 5 schools based on passing rate
 - School performance based on budget per student
 - School performance based on the type of school
 - School performance based on the school population size

### How is the district summary affected?
 - After adjusting the district analysis and removing the Thomas High School's 9th grades' scores, the district summary has not been affected much. The overall passing percentage has gone down from 65% to 64.9%.

### How is the school summary affected?
 - After adjusting the school analysis, the school summary remains identical as a district. Thomas High School's summary has been altered trastically from 90.6$ to 65%.
