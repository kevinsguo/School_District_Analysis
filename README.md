# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is an analysis for an individual school district. The purpose is to create an detailed analyzation to get a better understanding of each school's performance relative to each other, and future budgeting prospects. The analyzation would also compare the results after Thomas High School's 9th grades were removed due to dishonesty questions. 

## Results

The calculated analysis are as follows:
 - The average math and reading scores received by students in each grade level of each school
 - Top 5 and bottom 5 schools based on passing rate
 - School performance based on budget per student
 - School performance based on the type of school
 - School performance based on the school population size
